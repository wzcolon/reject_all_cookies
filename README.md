## Installation

### From Source (Developer Mode)

       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reject-all-cookies.git
    cd reject-all-cookies
   ```

2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)

3. **Load the Extension**

   - Select the extension directory
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list

4. **Pin the Extension** (Optional)

### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

The extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store after review.

## Usage

### Automatic Mode (Default)

Once installed, the extension works automatically:

1. Visit any website with a cookie consent banner
2. The extension detects the banner within 1-2 seconds
3. It automatically clicks the "Reject All" button
4. The banner disappears and your privacy settings are saved

### Manual Controls

Click the extension icon to access the popup interface:

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle automatic rejection on/off
- **View Statistics**: See how many cookies you've rejected
- **Settings**: Configure notifications and auto-mode
- **Test Function**: Test the extension on the current page
- **Reset Stats**: Clear your usage statistics

### Settings

- **Auto Mode**: Automatically reject cookies (enabled by default)
- **Show Notifications**: Display notifications when cookies are rejected
- **Extension Status**: See if the extension is active

## How It Works

### Detection Algorithm

1. **DOM Monitoring**: Uses MutationObserver to detect new elements
2. **Pattern Matching**: Identifies cookie banners using:
   - Element selectors (class names, IDs, data attributes)
   - Text content analysis
   - Framework-specific patterns
3. **Button Detection**: Locates reject buttons using:
   - Semantic selectors (`data-testid`, `aria-label`)
   - CSS class patterns
   - Text content matching

### Rejection Process

1. **Validation**: Ensures the button is visible and clickable
2. **Multiple Methods**: Uses both `.click()` and synthetic events
3. **Verification**: Avoids clicking "Accept" buttons by analyzing text content
4. **Logging**: Records successful rejections for statistics

### Key Classes

- **CookieRejectService**: Main content script service
- **BackgroundService**: Handles extension lifecycle and statistics
- **PopupManager**: Manages popup interface and user interactions

## Development

### Building from Source

No build process required - the extension uses vanilla JavaScript.

### Testing

1. Load the extension in developer mode
2. Visit websites with cookie banners
3. Use the "Test on Current Page" button to create a simulated banner
4. Check browser console for debug messages

### Adding New Selectors

To support additional cookie frameworks, edit `content-script.js`:

1. Add selectors to the `rejectSelectors` array
2. Add banner detection patterns to `bannerSelectors` array
3. Test with websites using that framework

## Privacy & Security

- **No External Requests**: All processing happens locally
- **No Data Collection**: The extension doesn't collect or transmit user data
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary Chrome API permissions
- **Open Source**: Code is fully auditable

## Permissions Explained

- **activeTab**: Access current tab to detect and interact with cookie banners
- **storage**: Store user preferences and statistics locally
- **scripting**: Inject test functionality (used only for manual testing)

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 required)
- Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, etc.)

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

### Adding Support for New Platforms

If you encounter a cookie consent platform that isn't supported:

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Find the banner element and reject button selectors
3. Add them to the appropriate arrays in `content-script.js`
4. Test and submit a pull request

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. Check if extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
2. Verify the site has a supported cookie banner type
3. Try manually disabling and re-enabling the extension
4. Check browser console for error messages

### False Positives

If the extension incorrectly identifies elements:

1. Disable the extension temporarily
2. Report the issue with the website URL
3. Use the toggle to turn off auto-mode if needed

### Performance Issues

The extension is designed to be lightweight, but if you experience issues:

1. Check statistics to see if unusually high activity
2. Reset statistics if they're very large
3. Disable and re-enable if needed
