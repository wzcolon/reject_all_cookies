# Privacy Policy for Reject All Cookies Extension

**Last Updated:** November 2024

## Overview

Reject All Cookies ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Reject All Cookies is designed with privacy in mind. We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

- Personal information (names, emails, addresses)
- Browsing history or website data
- Cookies or tracking data
- Search queries or form inputs
- Financial or payment information
- Location data
- Device information beyond what's necessary for functionality

## Information We Store Locally

The extension stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

### User Preferences
- Extension on/off status
- Notification preferences
- Auto-mode settings

### Usage Statistics (Optional)
- Count of rejected cookie banners
- List of website domains where banners were processed
- Timestamps of extension activity

**Important:** This information never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## How the Extension Works

1. **Content Script Injection**: The extension injects scripts into web pages to detect cookie consent banners
2. **Local Processing**: All detection and rejection logic runs locally in your browser
3. **No External Communication**: The extension does not communicate with any external servers or services
4. **Local Storage Only**: Settings and statistics are stored using Chrome's local storage API

## Data Sharing

We do **NOT** share any data with third parties because we don't collect any data in the first place.

## Chrome Extension Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To interact with the current webpage and detect cookie banners
- **storage**: To save your preferences and statistics locally on your device
- **scripting**: To inject test functionality when you manually test the extension

These permissions are used solely for the extension's functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

Cookie Reject All does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age.
